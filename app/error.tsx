// Automatically wrap a route segment and its nested children in a React Error Boundary.
// Create error UI tailored to specific segments using the file-system hierarchy to adjust granularity.
// Isolate errors to affected segments while keeping the rest of the app functional.
// Add functionality to attempt to recover from an error without a full page reload.
