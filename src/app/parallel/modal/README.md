This slot returns the modal if the segment is `/parallel/modal/login` or `/parallel/modal/signup`.
The `useSelectedLayoutSegment` function is used to get the current segment from `layout.tsx`.
We can dismiss the modal by calling `router.back()` or by using a `Link` component.
The reason is that `default.tsx` returns null.
If we want to navigate elsewhere and dismiss a modal, you can also use a `catch-all` route.
