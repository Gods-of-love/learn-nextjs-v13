### Route Groups

1. Organizing routes into groups e.g. by site section, intent, or team.

2. Enabling nested layouts in the same route segment level:
   - Creating multiple nested layouts in the same segment, including multiple root layouts
   - Adding a layout to a subset of routes in a common segment
